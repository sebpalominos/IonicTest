    <h4>Why does the app need your internet banking details?</h4>
    <p>Whether you have your accounts with a bank, credit union, trust or card program, your accounts contain data about your balances, transactions and spending. OPICA Insights uses your transactions and turns them into fact-based insights about your spending habits. We use internet banking as a quick and easy way for you to connect your spending data into our categorisation engine.</p>

    <h4>What do you do with my banking details?</h4>
    <p>We access your banking data every half an hour, to synchronise any of your new transactions. Throughout the process, your data is encrypted in transit, and also encrypted when sitting on our data servers.</p>

    <h4>Can you make transactions on my behalf?</h4>
    <p>No, we can't. OPICA Insights is only allowed to read your account statements for the purposes of categorising transactions. We cannot make transactions or change any of your account settings.</p>

    <h4>Do the categories get saved back to my bank?</h4>
    <p>No, the categories stay within the OPICA Insights app. We have read-only access to you accounts, and we cannot transact or save any other information back to your bank account.</p>

    <h4>Later on, can I discontinue the connection?</h4>
    <p>Yes, at any time you can revoke our connection to your bank data. This means that we will no longer be able to keep your account/spending data in sync. We canâ€™t delete the synced accounts immediately, but you can also choose to delete the stored data as well as revoking the connection.</p>
